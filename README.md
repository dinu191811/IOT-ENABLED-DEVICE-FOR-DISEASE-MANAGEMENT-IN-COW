 The project demonstrated an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled tool for disease
 management and predictive monitoring in cows that combines several technologies
 to provide a complete animal health monitoring solution. The system continuously
 collects critical physiological data from cattle by integrating sensor networks,
 such as temperature, humidity, heart rate, and respiratory rate sensors, with
 microcontrollers like the Arduino UNO and ESP8266. This data is wirelessly
 sent to a ThingSpeak for real-time visualization through a ThingView. A web
 application based on Streamlit then analyzes it further using pre-trained machine
 learning models for binary classification of animal health status. A rule-based
 threshold system combined with sophisticated predictive analytics guarantees the
 early detection of possible health problems like fever, heat stress, or respiratory
 infections.The model, which was
 trained on a sizable dataset including past and real-time sensor readings, accom
plishes prediction accuracies of 80%-95% under controlled conditions. Through the
 integration of rule-based thresholding and data-driven analytics, the system provides
 timely health status assessments and personalized intervention recommendations via
 graphical dashboards.
